Dylan Thomas vividly conveys the speaker's attitude towards death and dying through use of repetition, personification, and specific connotation and denotation to show that the speaker wants to fight death, but accepts that it will happen eventually.. The speaker repeats the phrases "do not go gentle into that good night" (1,6,12,18) and "rage, rage against the dying of the light" (3,9,15,19)" multiple times in the poem, showing his fight against death. With "good night" and "dying of the light" representing death, the speaker shows that he has a personal fight against death. This is immediately shown with phrases first shown at the beginning of the poem, giving us a clear understanding of the speaker's fight against death, and is emphasizes with the repetition, clearly showing the reader that the speaker hates death and wants to fight it until the end. This is reinforced with the personification of items related to death, such as old age that "should burn and rave at close of day" (2), wise men's words forking "no lightning" (5), and the deeds of men dancing "in a green bay" (8). The speaker is personifying that old age should fight to the end of death, that wise men continue to try and live because their words had no effect on the world, and that in the end, people eventually do die, with their deeds going to the "green bay", which represents the afterlife. This helps reinforce the speaker's fight against death, with him using the examples of personification to show that he wants to fight against death to the end, but knows it will come eventually, as shown through his personification of the "green bay".
